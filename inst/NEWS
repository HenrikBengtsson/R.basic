Package: R.basic
================

Version: 0.53.0 [2013-05-30]
o Package passes R CMD check on R v3.0.0 and R devel.
o CLEANUP: Dropped R (< 1.9.0) workarounds for assertVersion() and
  packageDescription(), because package requires R (>= 2.10.0).
o CLEANUP: Now R.basic::abline() calls graphics::abline() internally.
o CLEANUP: Now local hist.default() is a wrapper calling
  graphics::hist.default() instead of being a copy of it.
o CRAN POLICY: Now all Rd \usage{} lines are at most 90 characters long.
o CRAN POLICY: Now all Rd example lines are at most 100 characters long. 


Version: 0.52.0 [2013-02-07]
o Package passes R CMD check on R v2.15.2 with 1 WARNING.
o Updated package to have a NAMESPACE.
o BUG FIX: ListVector no longer defines a Class constructor, but just
  a plain function. This because it may return NULL, which is invalid
  R.oo code.


Version: 0.51.0 [2012-05-04]
o BUG FIX: zscore(..., robust=TRUE) estimated the standard deviation
  incorrectly as the square root of MAD, when it should have been MAD.
  This error has probably been there since the very early days.
  Thanks Taku Tokuyasu at UCSF for spotting this.


Version: 0.50.2 [2012-03-27]
o ROBUSTNESS: Now plotParallel() calls axis() with full argument names.


Version: 0.50.1 [2011-06-06]
o CONSISTENCY: For consistency with the renaming of tail() to tail2(),
  we also renamed head() to head2().  It will also lower the risk of
  conflicting with the head() function available in the 'utils' package
  of more recent versions of R.
o CONFLICT/BUG FIX: Renamed tail() to tail2(), because in more recent
  versions of R there is another tail() defined in the 'utils' package.
  For such version of R, Rterm on Windows would hang on TAB completion.
  Thanks "Neal" for report on this problem.


Version: 0.50.0 [2010-11-28]
o Package passes R CMD check on R v2.12.0.
o This release is provided such that the package installs
  correctly and pass R CMD check on R v2.12.0.  There is no
  guarantee that the methods works correctly.  For the next
  release, the plan is to clean out deprecated functions and
  utilize existing functions available elsewhere, e.g. factorial().
o Using packageStartupMessage() instead of cat().
o CONSISTENCY: Updated the name of the argument for factorial()
  to match that of base::factorial().  The latter didn't exist
  when it was first added to this package.
o EXAMPLES: Updated a few examples so that they don't give an error.
o DOCUMENTATION: Fixed a few Rd syntax errors and updated a few
  Rd cross references.
o DEPRECATED: about() is deprecated and will thrown an exception.
o Renamed HISTORY to NEWS.
o Updated to use x.y.z version format.


Version: 0.49 [2006-02-14]
o Removed all methods that were deprecated in v0.48.  Please install
  aroma.light for these.


Version: 0.48 [2006-02-13]
o The following methods have been moved to the aroma.light package and
  is therefore made deprecated in the R.basic package and will be
  removed from the latter in the future: distanceBetweenLines(),
  iwpca(), wpca(), robustSmoothSpline(), robust.smooth.spline(),
  likelihood.smooth.spline(), print.SmoothSplineLikelihood(),
  weightedMedian(), and weighed.median().


Version: 0.47 [2006-02-10]
o Removed image.matrix(), which has been deprecated for almost a year.
  Package now pass R CMD check without warnings.


Version: 0.46 [2005-07-19]
o Renamed weighted. median() to weightedMedian() and robust.smooth.spline()
  to robustSmoothSpline(). The formers remain, but will soon be deprecated.


Version: 0.45 [2005-06-12]
o Package now depends on R.utils because many methods have moved there;
  Moved capitalize(), commandArgs(), doCall(), gunzip(), insert(),
  intToBin(), intToHex(), intToOct(), isZero(), patchCode(), relibrary(),
  and seqToHumanReadable() to R.utils.


Version: 0.44 [2005-02-25]
o Updated the internal list of reserved arguments for commandArgs().
o Added argument 'asValues' to commandArgs(). If TRUE, arguments
  will be parsed such that --foo=value will be returned in a
  named list containing the element 'foo' with string value 'value'.
  Simple argument, say, --details, will be returned as an element
  with value TRUE and name 'details'.


Version: 0.43 [2005-02-20]
o Added image270() to replace image.matrix() in future versions.
o Package now passes R CMD check with 1 warnings, which is due
  to deprecated image.matrix().
  On R v2.0.1 devel there is a warning about 'modreg' has merged
  with 'stats'.
o Removed a few functions that patched R v1.4.x.
o Removed function rgb() because it was included in R v1.6.0.
o Added '...' arguments to please R CMD check.
o Updated broken Rd links.
o TO DO: Several definitions are still "hard coded" function
  definitions, which does not make use of setMethodS3().
  This should be fixed in future versions.
o TO DO: Several functions/methods needs to be documented.


Version: 0.42 [2005-02-09]
o Added support for weights in robust.smooth.spline().
o Added weight functions "symmetric" (Tukey's biweight; default) and
  "tricube" to iwpca(). In addition to this, any function can now be
  used as a weight function.
o All plot functions with argument 'col' now use default value
  col=par("col") and not col=NULL as before, which from R v2.0.0
  corresponds to "transparent" colors and not "black".
o normalizeQuantile() has moved to the aroma package and has
  been removed from this package.
o Added patchCode().


Version: 0.41 [2004-12-28]
o Added doCall().


Version: 0.40 [2004-10-15]
o Added seqToHumanReadable() which converts c(1:10, 15:18, 20))
  into "1-10, 15-18, 20".
o Package is no longer indepent of R.oo. This is for convenience
  in order to make use of setMethodS3().
o Updated DESCRIPTION with correct Depends and set LazyLoad to
  FALSE in order for package to install on both R v1.9.1 and
  R v2.0.0. In the future, when most people have migrated to
  R v2.x, LazyLoad will be turned on. This will probably happen
  when R v2.1.0 comes out in half a year.


Version: 0.39 [2004-06-27]
o Added the gridOptim() function and the ListVector class.


Version: 0.38 [2004-04-21]
o Fixed deprecated warning about package.description() that
  occured R v1.9.0 such that the code still works for older
  versions of R. This was needed for about() and assertVersion().
o Fixed error with plot.histogram() that occured because it
  is from R v1.9.0 a private function in the graphics package.
o Fixed R v1.9.0 "modreg -> stats bug" in smooth.spline.fit().
o Added support for weights in iwpca(), weights that in each
  iteration are multiplied by the internal residual weights.
  This will for instance make it possible to do windowed IWPCA
  in one or two dimensions.


Version: 0.37 [2004-04-07]
o Added a second example to wpca() comparing ordinary and orthogonal
  linear "regression" with and without intercept.


Version: 0.36 [2004-03-09]
o Added the weighted principal component analysis (WPCA) method wpca().
o The iterative re-weighted PCA (IWPCA) method iwpca() is now making
  use of wpca() instead of the acp() function in the 'multidim' package.
  Thus, R.basic is all that is needed for iwpca() to work.
o Made more use of Rdoc comments, which in turn resulted in much less
  warnings in R CMD check.


Version: 0.35 [2003-12-31]
o Added gunzip() from the com.braju.sma package.
o Added distanceBetweenLines().
o Added iwpca() for fitting R-dimensional hyperplanes using iterative
  re-weighted PCA.
o Added drawGrid().
o BUG FIX: Internally argument 'lty' and 'lwd' of lines3d() should have
  a length equal to the number of points minus one. Forgot to subtract one.


Version: 0.34 [2003-07-07]
o BUG FIX (R v1.7.x related): image.matrix() would generate the error
  "evaluation is nested too deeply: infinite recursion?", which happened
  because image() was called internally and not image.default().
o BUG FIX (R v1.7.x related): R CMD would give an error for
  example(plotParallel) since it was using F instead of FALSE.
o Rdoc FIXES: Added some missing argument descriptions.


Version: 0.33 [2003-04-13]
o Package R.base has been renamed to R.basic and made deprecated to minimize
  the risk for mistaking the name with the base package in the R distribution.
o BUG FIX: The introduction of namespaces in R v1.6 made the plot.histogram()
  function overloaded here stop working. The reason is that now
  hist.default() needs to live in the same environment as plot.histogram().


Version: 0.32 [2003-03-03]
o Made all 3D plot functions generic functions.
o BUG FIX: The internal plot() function had ylim=c(0,1) hard coded making
  horizontal=FALSE to fail working. I can not remember when I introduced
  this bug, but it used to work at some time.
o BUG FIX: depthOrder=TRUE for points3d() messed up the order of the
  arguments cex, col and pch. This bug was introduced in previous update.


Version: 0.31 [2003-02-21]
o Added primeFactors() to factorize a positive integer into prime factors
  and allFactors() to factorize a positive integer into all possible
  factors, including, but not only, prime factors.
o Added the functions nChooseK() to calculate "n choose k", gcd() to
  calculate the greatest common divider between two integers and isZero()
  to check if a value is zero, i.e. close to zero, or not.
o Updated error message of lines.loess() to contain data.class(x) instead
  of class(x).
o Added methods for generating and enumerating permutations of a vector.
  The lexicographicPermutations() and lexicographicPermutation() function
  generated all and only the n:th lexicographic permutation(s) of a vector.
  The generic function permutations() is a wrapper function that calls
  any of the defined permutation generator functions.
o Added stem3d() to add stems, i.e. points with lines going down to the
  xy plane (optionally the xz plane or the yz plane and in any direction).
o Add some extra information to the perspective matrix returned by plot3d()
  as it might be needed by other plot functions, e.g. stem3d() need the zlim.
o Update the help page for weighted.median() with description of the
  arguments 'method'.


Version: 0.30 [2003-01-07]
o Added capitalize() and decapitalize().
o Added argument depthOrder=TRUE to plot3d() and points3d() to specify if
  the data points should be plotted back-to-from relative to the view plane
  or not. If not, the plotting will be faster.


Version: 0.29 [2002-11-28]
o Added arguments 'xlim=NULL' and 'ylim=NULL' to plotParallel().


Version: 0.28 [2002-11-24]
o Added insert().


Version: 0.27 [2002-11-04]
o Now the rgb() function is only loaded for pre R v1.6.0 systems.
o Added lines() for class loess, i.e. lines.loess().
o Added polygon3d(). Note that angle is still not adjusted for the 3d
  transformation.
o Added pointsOnSphere().


Version: 0.26 [2002-10-24]
o Added normalizeQuantile(), which was adapted from Ben Bolstad/Gordon Smyth
  normalize.quantile(), but this one also accepts weights and the option
  to calculate the average sample distribution using the median function.
o Made the package to comply with the new Rx.oo package, which actually
  should mean nothing to this package, but I can not remember.


Version: 0.25 [2002-10-14]
o Added factorToNumeric().


Version: 0.24 [2002-07-18]
o Added intToBin().


Version: 0.23 [2002-07-12]
o size() now also works for data frames.
o BUG FIX: intToHex(0) and intToOct(0) gave "". The problem was in
  as.character.oct/hexmode().
o Added argument 'maxColorValue' to rgb().


Version: 0.22 [2002-06-28]
o Added apply2d().
o Added an extended version of commandArgs().
o Updates to weighted.median(): Made argument na.rm=FALSE as default
  for efficiency reasons. Improved speed somewhat. Added argument
  method=c("quick", "shell") for speed improvement. Added simple
  benchmark information in the help.


Version: 0.21 [2002-05-31]
o Added the matrix manipulation methods, flip.matrix(), mirror.matrix(),
  rotate90.matrix(), rotate180.matrix(), rotate270.matrix().
o Added rgb2col(), which is the inverse function to col2rgb().
o The output of intToHex() and intToOct() is of the same dimensions as
  the input.
o Added image.matrix(), which simplify rotates the matrix/image
  90 degrees clockwise before sending it to image(). The Rd example is
  useful!


Version: 0.20 [2002-05-25]
o This package passes the R CMD check test with 5 warnings.
o BUG FIX: getTerminalInfo() gave an error if R was run with stdin
  redirected from a file since 'stty -a' is used.


Version: 0.19 [2002-05-05]
o throw() and trycatch() are now also available in the R.oo package
  and they are identical. Maybe they will be removed from here in
  the future.
o Added a trial version of packagePaths().


Version: 0.18 [2002-04-24]
o Added lines.loess() for easier plotting of the loess lines.
o Added mad.loess() which estimates the mad() of the loess fitted
  data as a function of the control variables. By default a two sided
  estimation is done.


Version: 0.17 [2002-04-21]
o Redefined throw.default() so it takes several arguments, which are then
  pasted together with sep="". In other words, instead of doing
    stop(paste("bla bla", "value:", x, ".\n", sep=""))
  one can now do
    throw("bla bla", "value:", x, ".\n")


Version: 0.16 [2002-04-08]
o Now assertVersion() does give a more informative error message if
  the wanted package is not installed at all. It also writes a little
  bit about where to get information about the latest version of [R]
  if that is missing.
o Added intToOct() to convert integers to hexadecimal numbers.
o Added plotParallel() for plotting parallel coordinates.
o Added lines3d() for plotting lines in 3d plots.
o Added file.info() bug fix. To be removed when fixed in [R].


Version: 0.15 [2002-04-04]
o Added trial version of getTerminalInfo().
o Updated more() to make use of getTerminalInfo().


Version: 0.14 [2002-04-02]
o Added about() to easier get an overview of installed packages.
o Package now passes Rcmd check.


Version: 0.13 [2002-03-30]
o Added baseAndExtension() since it is used so often.


Version: 0.12 [2002-03-28]
o Added text3d().


Version: 0.11 [2002-03-14]
o Added plot3d() and points3d() after Ben Bolker's interesting email
  about persp() in the r-help mailinglist. Note that these methods
  plots the data on the correct z-order also, i.e. data at the back
  is plotted first and then the data at the front.


Version: 0.10 [2002-03-08]
o BUG FIX: "ANY" in trycatch() caught everything, not only exceptions.


Version: 0.9 [2002-03-02]
o Improved the speed for robust.smooth.spline(). Created an internal
  smooth.spline0(), which give identical output to smooth.spline(), but it
  is much faster if all x values are unique. It can two subfunctions;
  smooth.spline.prepare() and smooth.spline.fit(). These two function
  are of interest for robust.smooth.spline() which calls
  smooth.spline.prepare() only once, but smooth.spline.fit() repeatadly,
  a design which improves the speed significantly.
o Added a likelihood() method for class smooth.spline, which calculates
  the log likelihood (with components) for a fitted smoothing spline.
o Added a trial version of trycatch(). This required a minor modification
  of try(), which is still 100% compatible with the try() in [R] base.
o Update weigthed.median() to call median() when it is possible.
o Weights are currently not used robust.smooth.spline() more than
  internally.


Version: 0.8 [2002-02-18]
o Added robust.smooth.spline() to fit a smoothing spline with L_1 norm.
o Modified weighted.median() to (optionally) make use of linear
  interpolation to get a consistent estimate of the weighted median.
o Added a fix for the buggy [R] v1.4.1 version of matchSignature() in
  library 'methods'.
p Made the read.table() fix a [R] v1.4.0 fix only.


Version: 0.7 [2002-02-07]
o Added weighted.median().


Version: 0.6 [2002-01-25]
o Added assertVersion() to simply assertion of package versions.
o Added the fix of [R] base read.table() function according to
  the r-help mailing list. This fix will be removed when as soon
  as they will update [R].


Version: 0.5 [2002-01-17]
o Added zscore().
o Updated plot.histogram to be compatible with [R] v1.4.0.


Version: 0.4 [2002-01-10]


Version: 0.3 [2001-08-03]


Version: 0.2 [2001-07-24]


Version: 0.1 [2001-08-03]
o Created!
